## Core Analytics Methodologies

### 1. Descriptive Analytics: Understanding What Happened

Descriptive analytics forms the foundation of HR analytics, providing insights into historical trends and current state.

#### Essential HR Metrics and KPIs

**Talent Acquisition Metrics:**
- Time-to-fill (average days from job posting to offer acceptance)
- Cost-per-hire (total recruiting costs divided by number of hires)
- Quality of hire (performance ratings of new hires after 6-12 months)
- Source effectiveness (hire rate by recruiting channel)
- Candidate experience scores (survey ratings from candidates)
- Diversity hiring metrics (representation across demographic groups)

**Employee Engagement and Retention Metrics:**
- Employee engagement scores (survey results and pulse measurements)
- Voluntary turnover rate (percentage of employees who choose to leave)
- Involuntary turnover rate (percentage of employees terminated)
- Retention rate by demographic group (identifying equity issues)
- Time to productivity (days for new hires to reach full performance)
- Internal mobility rate (percentage of positions filled internally)

**Performance and Development Metrics:**
- Performance rating distributions (identifying rating inflation or bias)
- Goal achievement rates (percentage of employees meeting objectives)
- Training completion rates (participation in development programs)
- Skills gap analysis (comparison of current vs. required competencies)
- Succession planning readiness (percentage of key roles with ready successors)
- Leadership pipeline strength (high-potential employee development)

**Compensation and Benefits Metrics:**
- Compa-ratio (actual pay compared to market midpoint)
- Pay equity ratios (compensation comparison across demographic groups)
- Benefits utilization rates (percentage of employees using various benefits)
- Total rewards competitiveness (positioning vs. market benchmarks)
- Overtime and labor cost analysis (efficiency and cost management)
- Variable pay program effectiveness (correlation with performance)

#### Advanced Statistical Measures
Moving beyond basic averages and percentages to more sophisticated statistical analysis.

**Central Tendency Measures:**
- Mean (arithmetic average)
- Median (middle value in sorted data)
- Mode (most frequently occurring value)
- When to use each measure based on data distribution

**Variability Measures:**
- Range (difference between highest and lowest values)
- Standard deviation (measure of spread around the mean)
- Variance (square of standard deviation)
- Coefficient of variation (relative measure of variability)

**Distribution Analysis:**
- Normal distribution and its properties
- Skewness (asymmetry in data distribution)
- Kurtosis (tail heaviness in distribution)
- Percentiles and quartiles for understanding data spread

### 2. Diagnostic Analytics: Understanding Why It Happened

Diagnostic analytics helps identify the root causes behind observed trends and patterns.

#### Correlation Analysis
Understanding relationships between variables is crucial for identifying factors that influence HR outcomes.

**Correlation Coefficient Interpretation:**
- Values range from -1 to +1
- Positive correlation: variables move in the same direction
- Negative correlation: variables move in opposite directions
- Zero correlation: no linear relationship exists

**Common HR Correlations to Investigate:**
- Manager quality scores vs. team engagement levels
- Training investment vs. employee retention rates
- Compensation competitiveness vs. turnover rates
- Performance ratings vs. promotion rates
- Work-life balance scores vs. productivity metrics

**Correlation Cautions:**
- Correlation does not imply causation
- Spurious correlations can mislead analysis
- Non-linear relationships may not be captured
- Outliers can significantly impact correlation calculations

#### Root Cause Analysis Techniques
Systematic approaches to identifying underlying causes of HR issues.

**5 Whys Technique:**
A simple but powerful method for drilling down to root causes.

*Example: High Turnover in Sales Department*
1. Why is turnover high in sales? → Salespeople are leaving for competitors
2. Why are they leaving for competitors? → Competitors offer higher compensation
3. Why is our compensation lower? → Our pay structure hasn't been updated in 3 years
4. Why hasn't it been updated? → No systematic market review process exists
5. Why is there no review process? → Lack of HR analytics capability to monitor market trends

**Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram:**
Visual tool for identifying potential causes across multiple categories:
- People (skills, training, motivation)
- Process (procedures, workflows, systems)
- Environment (culture, workspace, policies)
- Technology (tools, systems, capabilities)

### 3. Predictive Analytics: Understanding What Will Happen

Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future outcomes, enabling proactive HR management.

#### Regression Analysis
Foundation technique for building predictive models in HR.

**Linear Regression Applications:**
- Predicting salary ranges based on experience and education
- Forecasting training costs based on employee growth projections
- Estimating time-to-productivity for new hires

**Multiple Regression Models:**
When multiple factors influence the outcome variable.

*Example: Predicting Employee Performance*
```
Performance Score = β₀ + β₁(Experience) + β₂(Training Hours) + β₃(Manager Rating) + β₄(Engagement Score) + ε
```

**Logistic Regression for Binary Outcomes:**
Predicting yes/no outcomes like promotion likelihood or turnover risk.

*Example: Turnover Prediction Model*
```
P(Turnover) = 1 / (1 + e^-(β₀ + β₁(Satisfaction) + β₂(Salary Ratio) + β₃(Manager Quality)))
```
